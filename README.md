# Applied Data Science Capstone 
## IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

## Subject of the Project 
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward fo 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 
<br /> 
## Hypothesis
In this Capstone, i have the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company SpaceY, that would like to compete with SpaceX. My job is to determine the price of each lunch. I did this by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards for my team. I also determined if Spacex will reuse the first stage. For these problems i trained a Machine Learning Model. 

## Process
As in all data science projects, i followed a framework that looks like the following. <br />
Raw Data Collection -> Clean Data -> Explore Data -> Visualize Data -> Use algorithms & predictive models -> Make decisions .
