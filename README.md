# Applied Data Science Capstone

Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward fo 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against Space X for a rocket launch. <br />
As in all data science projects, i followed a framework that looks like the following. 

## Process
Raw Data Collection -> Clean Data -> Explore Data -> Visualize Data -> Use algorithms & predictive models -> Make decisions .
